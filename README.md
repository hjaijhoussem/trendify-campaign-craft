└── README.md            # This file
```

### 🚀 First-Time Setup Walkthrough

1. **After starting the development server**, you'll see the TrendCampaign Pro dashboard
2. **Add your first product** by navigating to Products → Add Product
3. **Try different import methods**:
   - Manual entry for single products
   - CSV import for bulk products
   - URL scraping for existing product pages
4. **Explore trend analysis** on the Trends page
5. **Generate your first campaign** using the Campaign Generator

### 🔌 API Configuration

The application can work with or without a backend API:

#### **With Backend API**
```env
# .env.local
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
VITE_API_VERSION=1.0.0
```

#### **Without Backend (Mock Data)**
The application includes comprehensive mock data and will work perfectly for demonstration purposes without any backend setup.

### 📦 Backend API Setup (Optional)

If you want to connect to a real backend, the application expects these endpoints:

```bash
# Product Management
POST   /api/product        # Create new product
GET    /api/product        # Get all products
GET    /api/product/{id}   # Get specific product
PUT    /api/product/{id}   # Update product
DELETE /api/product/{id}   # Delete product

# Expected Product Schema
{
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string", 
  "category": "string",
  "price": "number",
  "imageUrl": "string",
  "keywords": "string (optional)",
  "isTrend": "boolean (default: false)",
  "trendingPercentage": "number (default: 0)"
}
```

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

#### **Common Issues:**

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# If port 5173 is busy, Vite will automatically use the next available port
# Or specify a different port:
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

**Node version issues:**
```bash
# Check your Node version
node --version

# Should be 18.0.0 or higher
# Update Node.js if needed: https://nodejs.org/
```

**Package installation errors:**
```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**TypeScript errors:**
```bash
# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Most TypeScript errors are automatically fixed by the development server
```

#### **Performance Tips:**

- **First load might be slower** as Vite optimizes dependencies
- **Hot reload** is enabled - changes appear instantly
- **Browser dev tools** are recommended for debugging
- **React Developer Tools** extension enhances debugging experience
